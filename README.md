# Streaming Aztecs

## Get Started

### 1) Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TomAFrench/Quachtli.git
cd client
yarn install
```

#### Switch to network Rinkeby

```sh
yarn start
```


Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web3 enabled browser to view the demo dapp. Make sure you are on the Rinkeby network and have some test eth. 

The Dapp will allow you to convert ERC20 tokens into zkTokens, send these zkTokens streamed around to other Ethereum addresses and withdraw from zkTokens back into ERC20 tokens.
