title: Interacting with NoteStream
---

# Can I cancel streams?

Yes. Both the stream sender and recipient can cancel the stream at any time. This will send the appropriate fraction of the stream note's value to each party and then delete the stream.

# Can I modify a stream in progress?
No. We're looking at the possibility to allow a stream's sender to modify a stream in progress in certain ways, e.g. extending the stream by topping up the stream note's value.
