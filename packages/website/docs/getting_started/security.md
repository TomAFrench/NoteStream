# Is NoteStream safe?
Currently there are a number of known security flaws which mean that NoteStream should not be used for any Mainnet funds (as such, there is no current Mainnet deployment.). I'm currently speaking with AZTEC about updates to their SDK in order to fix these.

All Notestream contracts are open source and verified on Etherscan.
