title:  How it works

## Where is my money held?

Each stream is made up of an AZTEC note locked on the NoteStream smart contract. The logic of this smart contract is such that only the stream's sender or receiver may interact with this note.

## How can my streams be private if everything on Ethereum is public?

You're right that everything that happens on the Ethereum network is available for anyone to inspect, however NoteStream uses AZTEC Protocol which allows funds to be transferred as "notes" for which the value is encrypted. Everyone can see that a stream exists but nobody but you will know how much value it contains.
