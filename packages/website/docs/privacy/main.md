There are a number of privacy enhancing measures you can take using ZkAssets which are general rather than NoteStream-specific. If this is the first time you will be using AZTEC Protocol, we recommend you view our ["Using Aztec notes"](/docs/privacy/using_aztec) page for more information.

Please see ["NoteStream-specific issues"](/docs/privacy/notestream_specific) for information on how your privacy is guarded by using NoteStream.
