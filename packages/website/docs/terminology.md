## AZTEC Note

AZTEC notes can be thought of as tokens on Ethereum for which all balances are encrypted so only their owners can view them.
This is a gross oversimplification as these notes instead work on UTXO model (similar to Bitcoin) rather than then fungible balance model of ERC20 tokens which are all familiar with.

## ZkAsset

A zero knowledge representation of an ERC20 token. For example: DAI is represented by the zkDAI ZkAsset.

## Stream Note
The AZTEC note held by the NoteStream contract for a given stream. This note represents the total value of the stream at any time.
